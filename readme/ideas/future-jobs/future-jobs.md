# Future jobs

- Fully digitized
- Fully data-streamed
- Enabled for AI

One more idea for [How future business might look like](future-business.md).

How future working place of any employee might look like? To enable numerous benefits of AI, as partly described in One more idea for [How future business might look like](future-business.md), it might be a good idea to consider that:

- any working place of any worker, whatever their job is, should be fully datastreamed
  - by design & by default
  - all inputs and outputs of any process they are involved in, all data & information exchange should be digitized and enabled as data in:
    - process-wide data-lake
    - org-wide data-lake

We might consider a new type of business (company, organization, team), fully digitized, meaning that **for any of its processes and resources, operations data is available in real-time 24/7**.

- What is the best and easiest way to implement data collection?
  - Would we consider each software having a way to stream and share all of its data and then adding it one by one to a data-lake?
  - Or collecting it in a different way, via network layer?

How do we digitize non-digital jobs?

- Cameras with ML models & real-time image recognition?
  - Is that approach enough qualitative and precise?
- Mix of software (ML models with inference) & physical devices to capture all necessary details and stream it in real-time?
  - Depending on the type of process and its specific characteristics, we might need different types of devices
