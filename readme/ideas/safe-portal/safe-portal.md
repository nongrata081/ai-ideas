Create a single open source tool with GUI that would make it easy to plan and execute an enterprise according to [SAFe](https://scaledagileframework.com/#full).

## Key ideas:

- **One single app** to cover the entire functionality **for** all respective **SAFe** hierarchy levels ([Full Portfolio](https://scaledagileframework.com/#full))
- Enable **replacement / enhancement of any human personnel by AI** on any SAFe role
  - **AI persona** for **every SAFe role** (easily executable via a GUI + conversational interface + ... ?)
    - Integrated with tools like [MGX](https://www.deepwisdom.ai/) (or [other](https://docs.deepwisdom.ai/main/en/blog/swebench/MetaGPT%20X%20Technical%20Report.html)) for (Multi-Agentic) **Natural Language Programming** (AI personas)
- Make this app an RAG-enabled (internal & external data sources, internet) **enterprise planning / execution asssistant** (real-time visibility, hints, reports, decisions, etc.)
  - AI-enabled + based on real-time data from all SAFe processes

## Use cases

- Web GUI wizard for:
  - [Customer centricity](https://scaledagileframework.com/customer-centricity/) (AI helper)
  - [Strategic themes](https://scaledagileframework.com/strategic-themes/) (examples, templates, 3d-party data inregration, e.g. for delegating)
  - [Participatory budgeting](https://scaledagileframework.com/participatory-budgeting/) (real-time prices from stores & suppliers for goods, services, etc.)
  - [Compliance](https://scaledagileframework.com/compliance/) (automate compliance verifications, progress maps, real-time updates from external sources (new laws, regulations, etc.))
  - [Solution intent](https://scaledagileframework.com/solution-intent/) (AI helper)
  - Each entity of SAFe

## Considerations

- Atlassian offers _Support for Safe_ with [Jira Align](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/align/safe). But the pricing starts **$ 46 000** annually with 30 users at minimum. What about having this software as open-source **FOR FREE** ? What if an enterprise consists of just 1 person, or a **small team** (several people), which would like to start and execute an enterprise according to the best practice (SAFe), yet without the **high entrance barrier** of the **cost** and **absence of dedicated software**? Having such an open-source software would make it easy for them to plan and execute following best practices, **with 1 click** and zero overhead.

## Long story told short

Free software for [SAFe](https://scaledagileframework.com/#full) for everybody.
