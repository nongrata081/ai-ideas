# List of data sources

Might be nice to have:

- a screen in a web/mobile app with a list of all available data-sources, e.g.:
  - room-123-camera
  - github repo
  - figma team space
  - slack / ms teams chat
  - miro desk
  - confluence
  - JIRA
  - etc.
- a detailed data-source card (with all relevant specs and information about each particular data source)
  - status (realtime data-streaming on/off?)
    - last successful data pulled from source + datetime, in case it is off
  - data output
