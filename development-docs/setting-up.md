# Setting up

### Preferred method - VSCode Dev Container

[VSCode dev containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) are a great way to containerize not only the necessary requirements but also recommended IDE extensions as well as settings such as pre-commit hooks and linting preferences. Using this will allow you to jump in to the perfect Enterprise Helper contribution environment without having to do much. Additionally, you'll be able to contribute through the web browser using Github Codespaces!

To use our dev container:

1. Download [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
2. Download [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. Within VSCode, install the [Remote Development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) extension
4. Open the VSCode command palette (`cmd / ctrl + shift + p`)
5. Select `Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in container`. A new VSCode window should open up and it should begin setting up your environment. Once it's done, you can open up a new terminal and start running tests or contributing!
6. To test that your environment is set up correctly,
   open `nx console` extension tab and try running one of the executors (e.g. linting / testing / etc). You should be able to run all executors and see the output in the terminal.
7. After the initial build, you should now be able to leave and re-enter the container any time without needing to rebuild. To do this, open the command palette and select `Dev Containers: Reopen in container`. This will not rebuild the container if you've done it correctly.

<!-- #### Alternative method - setup locally without containers

1.  Remove `package-lock.json` files (since those are platform specific and are generated by `npm install` for [linux docker image](mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/javascript-node:20-bookworm))
    and run `npm install` to get your platform-specific npm packages in `node_modules`

        ```shell
        # Create a new package-lock.json & install your platform-specific npm packages
        rm package-lock.json
        rm -rf node_modules
        npm install

        # Same for ai-ideas-nextra (knowledge base)
        cd ai-ideas/nextra
        rm package-lock.json
        rm -rf node_modules
        npm install
        ```

2.  Open `nx-console` extension tab in vscode and run executors from there or manually from the terminal, e.g.

    ```shell
    # linting
    npx nx run nextapp-ai-ideas:lint

    # dev with watch mode
    npx nx run nextapp-ai-ideas:dev

    # etc.
    ``` -->
