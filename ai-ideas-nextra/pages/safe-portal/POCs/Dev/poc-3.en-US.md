# Dev POC #3

Now that things start to come together bit by bit, I can think of putting it all together and implementing a chain of several entities in the POC#3.

- Open-source local ticketing system
- Open-source local knowledge base
- Open-source local software-engineer AI
- Reflect, what subset of these is smartest to start with (as for an individual) ? Features and user stories only? Does it make sense? Read about epics, capabilities, decide.
    - Strategic themes
    - Epics
    - Capabilities
    - **Features**
    - **User Stories**

The goal would be to have an entire flow working, fully locally, with steps:

- Define (generate) strategic themes (OKRs)
- Define (generate) features
- Define (generate) user stories
- Create (generate) tickets in local ticketing system
- Create (generate) articles in local knowledge base
- Generate solution by resolving tickets

While doing each of these steps, would be nice to reflect on the mechanics of interaction of human with the built system (what the results of the model are? how easy is it to reach a satisfactory result?). Better to keep expectations low, no idea if the results will be ok or not. One possibility is that quality of the generated stuff might be not good enough. However, putting things together might be already a significant step forward. And raising the quality might be one of the next steps. Even putting the UI together and bringing all the tools in one place, trying each of them out one by one, to get some handson experience, is already a lot. If I have familiarity with all these tools and have a UI, this by itself could already free up some space for cognitive load and attention for other things - like quality.
