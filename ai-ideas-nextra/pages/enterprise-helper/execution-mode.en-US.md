# Enterprise helper (execution mode)

For entrepreneurs, who are not experienced in running / starting an enterprise, there might be an **Enterprise helper** or **assistant**, that would help to plan and execute an enterprise step by step.

Herewith, for those users, who are willing to dive deeper into a certain topic / entity / activity, they'd be able to get help from the **helper AI** and provided with feedback and approach of SAFe - as to how it could be organized (both with humans, or fully AI-ified).

The main specificity about this app would be its simplicity and speed to results. A possibility to start from ground up without any knowledge on the topic, and be guided towards running business efficiently.
