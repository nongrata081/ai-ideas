# Integrations (with other tools)

- [ ] TODO: With which tools / systems does it make sense to implement integration? Why? What possible features could be implemented with it?
    - [composio tools](https://app.composio.dev/apps?category=all) ? [local tools](https://docs.composio.dev/introduction/foundations/components/local_tools#what-are-local-tools) ?
        - [browser tools](https://docs.composio.dev/introduction/foundations/components/list_local_tools#browser-tools)
        - file-system access [file management](https://docs.composio.dev/introduction/foundations/components/list_local_tools#file-management)
    - open-interpreter ?
- It makes sense to have an agentAI that would have **access to the computer's OS** and be able to perform any tasks with it

To accomplish complex automation, you must connect external applications, such as GitHub, Jira, Slack, Discord, etc., with AI models. For more clarity, check out our blog post on tool calling.

Composio makes it super easy to connect over 100 tools and applications, such as GitHub, Slack, Jira, Gmail, and more, with AI models to accomplish agentic automation.
