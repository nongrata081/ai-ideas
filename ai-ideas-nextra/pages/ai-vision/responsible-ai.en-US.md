**Trustworthy** means AI systems work as designed, are secure, and protect private information. When AI is trustworthy, it has the following attributes:

- **Privacy** – making sure customer and company confidential information doesn’t leak out, especially when using third-party AI tools

- **Security** – preventing hackers from compromising systems by taking advantage of AI’s weaknesses

- **Resilience** – handling attacks and fixing itself quickly if a part of the AI stops working

- **Reliability** – working as it should, being available when needed, performing quickly, and doing what it was created to do

- **Accuracy** – giving correct information and results

*When an AI system has all these qualities, companies and their customers are more likely to trust and rely on it.*

---

**Explainable AI** makes AI systems open and clear so people can understand how they arrive at the results they produce. This involves:

- **Transparency** – Making it easy to understand how AI systems work and how they produce results similar to a human’s output by providing clear documentation

- **Interpretability** – Ensuring that the way AI makes decisions is easy for humans to understand

- **Accountability** – Holding organizations responsible for AI behavior and outcomes

*When companies make their AI explainable, it helps fix mistakes faster and makes customers trust their AI more.*

**Human-centric AI** systems should always be safe and avoid harming people, property, or the environment. They should also respect the rules and values of society. Here are the key attributes of human-centric AI:

- **Safety** – Ensuring AI doesn’t pose any dangers to humans

- **Fairness** – Ensuring AI systems treat everyone equally, without bias

- **Ethics** – Ensuring AI systems follow the moral principles and values that society holds

- **Inclusiveness** – Ensuring AI considers the wide range of people who might use it

- **Sustainability** – Ensuring AI does not harm the environment

- **Compliance** – Ensuring AI follows existing laws, regulations, and standards
