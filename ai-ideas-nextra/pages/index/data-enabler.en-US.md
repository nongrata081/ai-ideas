# Data enabler

In AI age anything is (or might be) a data stream. The more data we have available, the bigger opportunities (and better precision) we get with AI.

It would be nice to have a tool that takes any source of data and turns it into a realtime broadcasted datastream, that is available online with one-click.

Imagine a sequence like:

- You have a datasource (of any kind)
- With one click you get the data from that datasource exposed online via an endpoint (GraphQL Data Gateway?) and broadcasted in realtime
- You get a URL of the datastream
- You paste this URL into a datalake, and data from that datasource becomes available there
