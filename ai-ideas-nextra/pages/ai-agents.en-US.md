An artificial intelligence **(AI) agent** refers to a **system or program** that is capable of **autonomously performing tasks** on behalf of a user or another system by designing its workflow and **utilizing available tools**.

AI agents can encompass a wide range of functionalities:
- beyond **natural language processing** including 
- **decision-making**, 
- **problem-solving**, 
- **interacting with external environments** and 
- **executing actions**.

These agents can be deployed in various applications to **solve complex tasks** in various enterprise contexts from software design and IT automation to code-generation tools and conversational assistants. **They use** the advanced natural language processing techniques of **large language models (LLMs)** to **comprehend** and **respond to user inputs** step-by-step and determine when to **call on external tools**.
