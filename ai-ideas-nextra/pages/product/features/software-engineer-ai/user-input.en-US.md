## Text prompt

### Text-only

```
Generate a next.js app with nx and MUI, that would have a drawer (responsive 
variant from MUI), and main content area split into two parts equal horizontally: 
entity description on the left (with text description of Stategic Themes from Scaled 
Agile Framework) and chat with AI on the right (like in openwebui).
```

## Prompt templates

- should we add **prompt-templates** (**in-context prompts**?) to the seai?
    - example: when prompting LM to generate a workspace with nx, it probably might perform the task much better if given an example of how the generated file structure with nx@vX.X.X might look like (for each given app framework / library / tool).
