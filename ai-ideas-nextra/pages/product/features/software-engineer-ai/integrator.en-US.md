# Integrator

> **Continuous integration** of different **software components** developed separately **into one system**.

A tool that uses LMs to continuously integrate 3d-party software (open-source libraries & apps) into my own apps & libs, seamlessly, without much manual work, by natural language interaction & flexibly enough to integrate it into my frontends / backends.

Example use-case: [Dev POC #3.1](http://localhost:3000/safe-portal/POCs/Dev/poc-3-1) (Assemble Enterprise Helper UI from several component apps)

---

- Could be be a tool to integrate any software in general, be it open-source or not, also for in-house development.
