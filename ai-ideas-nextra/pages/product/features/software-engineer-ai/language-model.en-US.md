## Data

- all data used for training of the LM (including human feedback data) should be [collected](#collection), [aggregated](#aggregation) and [stored](#storing) in a structured & properly [formatted](#format) way (according to a certain data format) for later usage in LM [training](#training).
- Data has to be [versioned](#versioning) and [released](#releasing) with git tags as a [dataset](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/en/index) in order to maintain [reproducibility](#reproducibility) of the training. (What if I want to train one model at some point? Then at a different time, another model? And compare their performance? Or build one from scratch, my own? Etc.). Introduce [Transparent Reproducible Training](#transparent-reproducible-training).
