# Release Distribution Options

For the software, created by Software Engineer AI, implement several distribution options out of the box:

- Build from source
    - For cases when full control over the code is needed
        - e.g.: for usage with custom dependencies || a very specific version of dependency
- Stable Releases
    - For the most stability
- **Nightly Releases**
    - For cases, when you want to make the code available with the latest code changes (bugfixes, features) landed in main branch during previous night
- Binaries (?)
