# Templates

for code generation

- add CRUD of templates for code generation
    - for example, a seed project that would have all best-practice in place for full-cycle AI development
        - front-end (s)
        - back-end (s)
        - LM (s)
        - database (s)
        - chore (for each of the above)
            - commit types standard
                - [e.g. data commit types](/product/features/software-engineer-ai/data/data-commit-types)
            - commitizen cli prompt
            - versioning
                - [e.g. data versioning](/product/features/software-engineer-ai/data/versioning)
            - changelog generation (semver)
                - [e.g. data changelog gen](/product/features/software-engineer-ai/data/changelog-generation)
            - releasing
                - [e.g. data releasing](/product/features/software-engineer-ai/data/releasing)
            - etc.
        - docs for all of the above + tutorials with [stackblitz/tutorialkit](https://github.com/stackblitz/tutorialkit)

It might be very useful & time-saving for newcomers into the field of AI / ML / Data development, not familiar with how certain things are implemented and work.
