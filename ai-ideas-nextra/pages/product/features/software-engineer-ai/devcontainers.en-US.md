# Devcontainers

Generate, maintain & operate on devcontainers according to [Devcontainers Considerations & Vision](/product/development/considerations/devcontainers-considerations)

- Scaffold a devcontainer setup, run it and develop everything in it
- Generate documentation for how to use a devcontainer + suggested [development workflow](/product/development/considerations/devcontainers-considerations/development-workflow) and [deployment (shipping) workflow](/product/development/considerations/devcontainers-considerations/deployment#deployment-shipping-workflow)
- the workflow should be: AI-first + human-assisted on-demand (a human developer should be able to able to chip into the development process with 1-click, in case if there is something that the AI cannot properly achieve or do itself). Possibly with [devpod](/product/development/considerations/devcontainers-considerations#devpod) ?
