# Ticket sequence

## Description

### Batch execution

Ticket sequence serves as:

- a container for **multiple tickets**

---

## CRUD of ticket sequences

Sequences can be created by: 

1. Creating a sequence label (?) (it can be a ticket itself + color label like in trello, with many fields, text description, so that model understands what is required from it, etc.)
2. Labelling tickets with the sequence label.

...

## Sharing ticket sequences

Ticket Sequences can be **saved** and **shared** (on the web with other users) as a versioned and **released library (package)**. Which is easy to install. Which means we're abstracting such entity as sequences away from the implementation, allowing it to be used by any other software engineering AI tool.
