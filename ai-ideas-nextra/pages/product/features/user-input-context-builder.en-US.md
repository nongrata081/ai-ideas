# User input context builder

- The central point in this entire thing is **user's input**. The app should **derive as much** from it, **as possible**. It should also be able to **build the current context around** it (use web-search to build the context around it as high in quality, as possible, e.g. existing tools, sources, that might be helpful, existing examples of such things on the market, existing regulations, etc). It would be nice if based on a user input the app can generate the entirety of SAFe entities right away. And then as user corrects the input, regenerate it again. Also, would be nice if a user gets several different variants of such generated entity sets. Also, a user should be able to correct separate entities, and then all other entities, that are somehow connected with that changed one, should also in some way reflect these changes and be updated - that should be analysed by the LM and suggestions should be generated - as to what changes occurred, what consequences it might bring, what can be done in order to maximize the positive effect (reaching the OKRs / Strategic themes).

- Reflect on how SAFe AI can bring people together by setting some common grounds for them regarding their work.
