# Facilitate scaling

(of OPs, & everything else) **from day 0**

- Starting with SAFe from scratch might also ease probable scaling for startups (?) like build things scale-enabled from day 0 (consider how Nx helps with that for building the frontend?).
- Architect app in such a way, that it helps to build things in an easily scalable way
