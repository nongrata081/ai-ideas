# nx AI generators

Context of [web-containers](/product/features/web-containers) that led to the origination of idea of **nx generators** for AI entities in an nx workspace:

- Generate a knowledge base
- Generate a litgpt setup
- download a model
    - generate a model ?
- download a dataset
    - generate a dataset ?
- train, finetune, test, evaluate, deploy, consume
- generate backend app
- generate frontend app (with Vercel AI SDK? + streaming, etc. ?)

Should I create a bunch of nx generators for it?

Then create a repo that showcases the results of generation as example and acts as a seed even?

## Considerations

- Creation of such generators would require maintenance
    - which is fine? so I maintain it?
- Having such an integrated toolkit seems to be an industry-wide needed thing, so developing it and maintaining totally makes sense as for the value for the community
