# Generate entities

Imagine a user (human) generating OKRs with AI. 

## Generate sequences of entities

Then step-by-step, approving and whenever needed, re-iterating on generation steps & correcting mistakes, generates all corresponding items downstream for all hierarchy levels (features, enablers, etc). Eventually, generating tickets (as user stories). And then generating the code for it, along with any other results needed (designs, documentation, etc).

## Suggest entities

- would be nice if a user can start at any point in the SAFe journey, and fill in some entity (-ies). And then, if based on those filled entities, the app can suggest filling in other ones. E.g. I can start either with creating a ticket, or writing a code, or formulating a solution intent, and based on that, other entities can be suggested (based on guessing of the user intent).
