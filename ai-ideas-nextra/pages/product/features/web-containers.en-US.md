## Web-containerize (Stackblitz-like) flows for AI-dev:

Web-containers are the present and future for sharing dev-environments, regardless of what is under development - frontend / backend / model / dataset or everything together integrated. 

It is easy, quick and enables reproducibility. Could be a **github seed repo** for such projects.

### minimalist LM / dataset development flow

- in a new browser tab:
    - code-editor - vscode
    - Language Model
    - dataset
    - litgpt to
        - pretrain
        - finetune
        - test
        - evaluate
        - deploy
        - consume

### integrated AI-app development flow

- in a new browser tab:
    - code-editor - vscode
    - Language Model
    - dataset
    - litgpt to
        - pretrain
        - finetune
        - test
        - evaluate
        - deploy
        - consume
    - backend (nest.js app) if necessary
    - frontend app (with Vercel AI SDK stuff, like streaming, etc.) that consumes the model
