# Knowledge base

(local open-source)

## TODO

- [ ] Do all [mintlify](/product/features/knowledge-base/mintlify)-related tasks
- [ ] For knowledge base - add a vector DB and make embeddings of all kb files (create vectors out of those and store them in DB);
    - add a UI to chat with knowledge base (to be able to extract knowledge fast);
    - enable search across the knowledge base (show not just occurrences in text, but also files)
    - [Obsidian + Cursor = Magical AI Knowledge Management](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxss50uZgE0)
- should we have a coursor like ide for free with local LMs?
- [ ] [TriliumNext/web-clipper](https://github.com/TriliumNext/web-clipper) - what an awesome feature!

## Approach

- Have a [tool for local knowledge base](/product/features/knowledge-base/knowledge-base-tools) for an enterprise
- Have curated sections of the knowledge populated with latest actual data on certain topics (AI (Ops), ML (Ops), Data (Ops), Software Engineering, Architecture, Infrastructure, etc.)
    - These sections might be curated be real people, geeks, interested in these topics and eager to provide the value to the community by maintaining these in actual state (including latest research) (all with open-source data)
    - This might save teams a lot of time for gathering and search of information on related topics
