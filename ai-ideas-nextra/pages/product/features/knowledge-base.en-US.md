# Knowledge base

(local open-source)



## Approach

- Have a [tool for local knowledge base](/product/features/knowledge-base/knowledge-base-tools) for an enterprise
- Have curated sections of the knowledge populated with latest actual data on certain topics (AI (Ops), ML (Ops), Data (Ops), Software Engineering, Architecture, Infrastructure, etc.)
    - These sections might be curated be real people, geeks, interested in these topics and eager to provide the value to the community by maintaining these in actual state (including latest research) (all with open-source data)
    - This might save teams a lot of time for gathering and search of information on related topics
