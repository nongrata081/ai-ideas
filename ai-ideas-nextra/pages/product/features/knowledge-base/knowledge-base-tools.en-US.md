    > Personal knowledge bases are perfect for aggregating, organizing, and accessing all your ideas, notes, and records. While Obsidian, Google Notes, and several other tools let you create a customized assistant to manage your personal records, Trilium Notes app is a solid self-hosted alternative if you want maximum privacy for your PKM system. 

    > Having used Trilium Notes extensively after covering it in my best obscure self-hosted services list, it’s an absolute game changer for my note-taking needs. If you’re an advanced user, you dive right into setting up your own tree/link nodes and journaling trees. 

    > Trillium also supports graphical drawings, tables, mathematical equations, and even programming codes, and you can further enhance the app’s functionality using extensions. Heck, the tool even supports snapshots in the form of note revisions!
