# Flavors

- Develop few flavors of the product:
    - Flavor types:
        - Individual usage
            - It'd be nice to build the product in a scalable way, e.g. default to usage by an individual person (assume open-source AI developer, who might also be a potential backer). Default to starting a product with a subset of SAFe, clearly beneficial for an individual open-source AI developer. (Those parts, that aren't such, could be opted in manually, if needed). Fields for those items would be present from scratch, but populated or not based on the flavor.
            - Focus on individual first. What for me as **for an individual** could be **clearly beneficial & useful** from the entire SAFe methodology? Default to those fields in "Individual Flavor".
        - Team
        - Corporate
        - etc.
    - Define, which entities are active by default for which flavors 
    - Create **different entry points into the app** (& supplement it with explanations) to facilitate different categories of users (Individual, Team, Corporate) with the app-flow & scope, pre-designed for them (different amount of active entities).
