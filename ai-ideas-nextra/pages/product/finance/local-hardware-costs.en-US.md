# Local Hardware Costs

- Different hardware can imply different operation cost for the same value.
- For example, choice to run a LM locally **on an external graphic card** can incur big expenses, as shown in [The HARD Truth About Hosting Your Own LLMs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMuBqcO048E)
    - high cost of the graphic card itself
    - high cost of the electricity it consumes (imply it running 24/7 by default)
