# Marketing

## Target market

- Young (or any other age) entrepreneuers willing to start and run an enterprise.
    - That don't have experience, understanding and vision about how to do it
    - That have it, but would like to improve it with best practice and industry standards
- Existing companies, that work according to SAFe

## Market strategy

This is just a hypothesis, that surely needs verification and might be subject to changes.

- Existing companies, that work according to SAFe
    1. Help companies that implement SAFe to run **existing** processes more efficiently with AI
    2. **Optimise** processes / positions / roles with AI (with human oversight if needed)
