# SAFe-portal considerations

- Each and every entity in [Full SAFe](https://scaledagileframework.com/#full) can be reflected on and thought of in the context of AI
    - is this item valid at all (was it introduced in the human era, and is something that might be optimised / improved with AI)?
    - how and what related to each item can be dealt with with AI?

- Enterprise Strategy
- [Strategic themes](https://scaledagileframework.com/strategic-themes/)
    - New ones: Could be formulated with AI based on data input (which data exactly? Which data could be considered sufficient for such task?)
        - Imagine performing a market analysis, and formulating OKRs based on and taking into account:
            - Data about competition
            - Changes in the environment (new laws? new markets? possibilities? restrictions?)
            - Resources that company has (personnel? data? finance? real estate? etc.)
    - Existing ones: Could be corrected or given more insights into with AI based on data input (which data exactly? everything from SAFe activities?)
        - Correction according to OKRs achievement dynamic?
        - Correction according to the change of the environment? (faster reaction to market events, better agility)
