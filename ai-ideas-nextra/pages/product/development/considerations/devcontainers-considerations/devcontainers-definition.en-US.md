# Definition of Dev Containers

> Dev containers are isolated, lightweight environments that provide a pre-configured development environment inside your editor or IDE. They save time by eliminating the need for manual setup and ensure a clean environment every time. Dev containers offer benefits such as pre-configured build environments, isolated environments, reproducible builds, less setup time, and flexibility in choosing base images.

## What Are Dev Containers?

Dev containers are isolated, lightweight environments that allow developers to work inside a containerized version of a build environment. Basically, dev containers give you a pre-configured development environment right inside your editor or IDE.

As a developer, dev containers can save you a ton of time setting up projects and ensure you have a clean environment every time you start working.

Some of the main benefits of using dev containers include:

- **Pre-configured build environments**. Dev containers come with a base image that has all the software, tools, and dependencies pre-installed so you can get started coding right away.

- **Isolated environments**. Each dev container has its own isolated filesystem, networking, memory, and CPU - so there are no conflicts with other projects or software on your local machine.

- **Reproducible builds**. Dev containers provide the exact same environment every time they're launched, so you get the same build results each time. No more "it works on my machine!" issues.

- **Less setup time**. Starting a new project with dev containers means you can skip the lengthy setup and configuration process. Just open your project in the container and everything is ready to go.

- **Flexibility**. You have options to choose a base image with the software and tools you want or build your own custom base image. So dev containers can flexibly meet your specific needs.

Dev containers revolutionize the developer experience by providing pre-configured, isolated environments that can supercharge your productivity. If you haven't tried them yet, you owe it to yourself as a developer to give dev containers a shot.

They may just change the way you work! The future is containerized!
