# Troubleshooting

- What should I do if my container fails to start?
    - Check the container logs using `docker logs <container-id>`, ensure your configuration files are correct, and verify that all dependencies are properly installed.
- How can I resolve slow performance issues?
    - Ensure your container has enough CPU and memory allocated, optimize your code to reduce disk I/O, and consider using faster storage options if disk access is a bottleneck.
- What can I do if I encounter network issues?
    - Ensure there are no port conflicts, and if your container cannot resolve domain names, try using a custom DNS server by adding `--dns` to your Docker run command.
- How do I handle dependency conflicts?
    - Ensure that the dependencies in your container match the required versions for your project. Use a package manager to manage dependencies and specify exact versions to avoid conflicts.
