# Enterprise helper (execution mode)

For entrepreneurs, who are not experienced in running / starting an enterprise, there might be an **Enterprise helper** or **assistant**, that would help to plan and execute an enterprise step by step.

Herewith, for those users, who are willing to dive deeper into a certain topic / entity / activity, they'd be able to get help from the **helper AI** and provided with feedback and approach of SAFe - as to how it could be organized (both with humans, or fully AI-ified).

The main specificity about this app would be its simplicity and speed to results. A possibility to start from ground up without any knowledge on the topic, and be guided towards running business efficiently.

Imagine we are targeting the segment of young entrepreneuers, who are willing to start their enterprise but lack experience / understanding about how to do it. Such AI helper would be able to assist them at every step of their customer journey, zero to hero.

- One of features could be testing their ideas versus real world, to see if there are already implementations of their idea / competition on the market.
- Another cool feature might be introducing SAFe's vocabulary and approaches for dealing with things in different domains. For example, for a young student, willing to run a business, with 0 knowledge about what and how, such software as **Business Planning Pro** and **Marketing Planning Pro** were like an eye-opening experience, opening a detailed approach into running a business, introducing best practice and industry standards. Same thing could be with the helper, which might help young entrepreneurs to build a certain **vision** and **approach** about how to run an enterprise. The entire SAFe methodology is doing that. An AI helper could be something, that helps do it with a **GUI and AI assistant**.
