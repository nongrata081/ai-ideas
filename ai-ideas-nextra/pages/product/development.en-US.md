# Product Development

## Approach

- **Start with frontend**
    - In terms of building the product, it seems that the approach of **starting with the frontend** is the simplest, fastest and most efficient way to go further. Because then the actual product can be seen and (to some extent) experienced right away.
- **Dive into details as needed**
    - there might be a lot of features to implement in LM ecosystem, but it's possible to drown in the amount of data without narrowing down to something. So maybe investing into feature development and research as I face such need is reasonable.
- One possible approach to development could also be - start with building a simple but well functioning **open-source tool for regular SAFe workflow** (without AI). Then, add AI capabilities to it.

## Frontend

- [ ] What frontend(s) should the product have? I can build it (or some of its parts?) with:
    - nextjs as a **web-app**
    - electron as a **desktop-app**
    - native mobile app
        - iOS
        - android
- [ ] update this part with reflections and considerations from latest findings: OpenHands, xterm.js, open-source ticket system, open-source knowledge-base
    - what capabilities does web-ui have? is it sufficient for my project goals as of now?
