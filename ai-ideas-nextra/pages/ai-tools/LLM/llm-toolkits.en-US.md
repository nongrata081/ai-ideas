- [transformers.js](https://github.com/xenova/transformers.js)
    - State-of-the-art Machine Learning for the web. Run ü§ó Transformers directly in your browser, with no need for a server!
    - Transformers.js is designed to be functionally equivalent to Hugging Face's transformers python library, meaning you can run the same pretrained models using a very similar API. These models support common tasks in different modalities, such as:
        - üìù Natural Language Processing: text classification, named entity recognition, question answering, language modeling, summarization, translation, multiple choice, and text generation.
        - üñºÔ∏è Computer Vision: image classification, object detection, and segmentation.
        - üó£Ô∏è Audio: automatic speech recognition and audio classification.
        - üêô Multimodal: zero-shot image classification.
