    - In S2ORC, a large corpus of 81.1M English-language academic papers spanning many academic disciplines is introduced, which is expected to facilitate research and development of tools and tasks for text mining over academic text.
    - We introduce S2ORC, **a large corpus** of 81.1M English-language academic papers spanning many academic disciplines. The corpus consists of **rich metadata**, paper abstracts, resolved bibliographic references, as well as structured full text for 8.1M open access papers. Full **text is annotated** with automatically-detected **inline mentions of citations, figures, and tables, each linked to their corresponding paper objects**. In S2ORC, we **aggregate papers from hundreds of academic publishers and digital archives into a unified source**, and create the largest publicly-available collection of **machine-readable academic text** to date. We hope **this resource will facilitate research and development of tools and tasks for text mining** over academic text.
