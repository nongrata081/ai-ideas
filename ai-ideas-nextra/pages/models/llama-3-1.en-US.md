## Generated Strategic Themes & OKRs

> I want to build an integrated solution, that would allow a user to resolve tasks on each step of SAFe with AI (local LLMs). It
...  should have a knowledge base (an open-source solution, probably nextra), a ticket system (also open-source, analogous to JIRA
... ), access to operating system and file system (to be able to CRUD of files, write code, etc). It might use multiple different 
... LLMs for different tasks depending on the domain. Create a set of strategic Themes, OKRs, that would reflect my idea.

Here's a possible set of Strategic Themes and OKRs that could guide the development of your integrated solution:

**Strategic Themes:**

1. **"Integrate AI-Powered Task Resolution"**: This theme focuses on developing an intelligent task resolution system that 
leverages local LLMs to assist users in completing tasks at each step of the SAFe framework.
2. **"Create a Knowledge Base for Domain Expertise"**: This theme emphasizes building a comprehensive knowledge base using 
open-source solutions like Nextra, which will serve as a foundation for domain-specific expertise and task resolution.
3. **"Implement an Integrated Ticketing System"**: This theme involves developing a ticketing system that integrates with 
the knowledge base and AI-powered task resolution system, mirroring the functionality of JIRA but tailored to your specific 
use case.
4. **"Provide Access to Operating System and File System Resources"**: This theme focuses on ensuring seamless integration 
with the operating system and file system, enabling users to perform CRUD operations, write code, and interact with files in 
a controlled environment.

**OKRs:**

**Objective:** "Integrate AI-Powered Task Resolution"

* **Key Results:**
	+ Develop a working prototype of the AI-powered task resolution system using local LLMs within 6 months.
	+ Achieve an accuracy rate of at least 80% for task resolution suggestions generated by the system within the next 9 months.

**Objective:** "Create a Knowledge Base for Domain Expertise"

* **Key Results:**
	+ Integrate Nextra with the ticketing system and AI-powered task resolution system within 3 months.
	+ Develop a comprehensive knowledge base covering at least 5 domains, each with a minimum of 500 relevant articles and resources within the next 12 months.

**Objective:** "Implement an Integrated Ticketing System"

* **Key Results:**
	+ Develop a working prototype of the integrated ticketing system within 4 months.
	+ Achieve an average resolution time of less than 2 days for tickets assigned to AI-powered task resolution within the next 9 months.

**Objective:** "Provide Access to Operating System and File System Resources"

* **Key Results:**
	+ Develop a working prototype of the OS/file system integration within 5 months.
	+ Achieve an accuracy rate of at least 90% for file operations (CRUD) performed through the integrated interface within the next 12 months.

**Domain-Specific LLMs**

To reflect your idea, you might consider additional OKRs that focus on integrating multiple LLMs for different domains. For example:

* **Objective:** "Integrate LLMs for Software Development"
	+ Key Results:
		- Integrate a software development-specific LLM with the AI-powered task resolution system within 6 months.
		- Achieve an accuracy rate of at least 85% for code suggestions generated by the integrated LLM within the next 9 months.

* **Objective:** "Integrate LLMs for DevOps"
	+ Key Results:
		- Integrate a DevOps-specific LLM with the AI-powered task resolution system within 6 months.
		- Achieve an accuracy rate of at least 80% for infrastructure provisioning suggestions generated by the integrated LLM within the next 9 months.

These are just some possible OKRs and Strategic Themes that could guide your project. You may need to adjust or add to them based on your specific requirements and needs.

1. Value Propositions The value propositions describe the customers and the value delivered by the solutions of each value stream, as well as the customer segments and relationships, budget, and KPIs /revenue. Create a separate row for each development value stream. Value Streams: The development value streams used to build the systems and capabilities that enable business processes in operational value streams or provide products and services to the operational value streams. Solutions: Each value stream produces one or more solutions, which are the products, services, or systems delivered to the customer, whether internal or external to the enterprise. Customers: Customers describe the internal or external customers for each value stream. It defines how the business views and treats various sets of customers differently based on their common attributes. Channels: Explains how the enterprise delivers its products and services to intermediaries, customers, and end-users. If serving external customers, this may include marketing and sales mechanisms used to reach customers (e.g., web, direct sales, brick-and-mortar store, distribution network). If serving internal customers, it captures the interfaces with internal stakeholders and end-users (for example, internal websites or custom IT applications). Customer Relationships: The types of customer relationships needed to effectively apply and leverage the business’ products and services. It describes the connections and communications with each customer segment. These relationships influence the design of solutions and the allocation of resources within the portfolio. Budget: Each value stream is assigned a Lean Budget, which includes operating, overhead, and capital expenses. KPIs / Revenue: Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) define the measures used to evaluate the results of the value stream investment. 

2. Resources and Activities The resources and activities describe the key partners, activities, and other resources needed to achieve the value propositions. Key Partners – The various buyer-supplier relationships and business alliances that facilitate achieving the value proposition. Key Activities – The enterprise’s most important actions to deliver its products and services. Key Resources – The enterprise’s critical physical, intellectual, financial, human, and other capabilities and assets used to achieve its objectives. 

3. Cost Structure and Revenue Streams The cost structure and revenue streams describe how the portfolio’s costs are structured and define how revenue or value is achieved. Cost Structure: Identifies the most significant costs in the portfolio’s business model, including the structural aspects, such as license costs, development labs, and costs of external services. Building cyber-physical systems also have other costs (for example, hardware and firmware), which must be considered. Revenue Streams: If the development value streams monetize directly, list the types and sources of revenue from customers. Note the major sources of revenue and how the customer is charged (fixed price, usage-based, and so on). For internal customers, non-profits, and government agencies, describe the value of the solutions.
