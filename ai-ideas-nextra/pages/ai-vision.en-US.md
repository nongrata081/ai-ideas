# AI vision

## Releasing AI

Autogenerate **changelogs**, have **build artifacts** for:
- apps / libs
- models / data

Introduce **release-context** for an AI-app, that would have references to everything related to a release, similar to the [ticket-context](/product/features/ticket-system/ticket#ticket-context) or [repo-context](/safe-portal/POCs/Dev/poc-6#61-repo-contextjson).

## DevOps + MLOps CI

In AI age being able to ship reliable software implies that you have to run all OPS (traditional **development operations** for linting, building, testing,  etc. for applications and libraries & **machine learning operations** like training, fine-tuning, evaluating, etc) in an automated way in **CI** as a part of your every-day development / training workflow and for making releases.

## Web-containers & bolt.new

Revolution in AI. bolt.new -like apps will most probably soon take over in every field. Imagine apps with chat with LM on the left-side + web-containerized dev environment on the right side - with an OS and stack of software (Penpot for UI prototyping, Databases and anything else open-source for any kind of work), fully manipulated by LM.

Long story told short.
