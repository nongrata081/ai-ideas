# Future companies

How future business might look like

- Fully digitized
- Fully data-streamed
- Enabled for AI

I can imagine a world where it is possible to get all the benefits described in [org-wide (voice) chat with docs](org-wide-chat-with-docs.md#why) for a new business out of the box.

## Future business

### AI-ified information exchange from day 1

Imagine, you want to start a company. Wouldn't it be nice to have a possibility for you and all your teammates to interact with all company-related (and its processes-related) knowledge via a (voice) chat interface? And get any answer on any of your questions instantly without having to disturb your colleagues, thus saving their time, your employers money and making your team lean and competitive on the market, due to freeing up your team's resource from information exchange and making it available for value delivery?

As for me, this seems very logical and even inevitable.

## Transaction costs of human interaction

The transaction costs (expenses, that teams have on communication and exchange of information) are typically very high. Starting with finding that guy who wrote uncommented piece of code, and clarifying things about it, or spending time on a meeting to discuss how something works, or why it doesn't, etc. In practice, all such human interactions are subject to human factor, that sometimes (or oftentimes? or almost always, to some extent?) might affect the process of information exchange. Sometimes by making it slower and harder. The quality of such information exchange might depend on things like nature and character of your interpersonal relations. Or emotional state of your colleague at the time such exchange is being held. Or their physical condition. Are they tired at the end of the day, but you need that info now? Etc.

## Data first

This requires a new approach and mindset as for the data. In the AI age availibility of data is the key competitive factor. It might become an advantage if an actor (person, team, organization) makes it available for themselves and for the tools they use.

- All data has to be available
- Availibility of data has to become a value
- All tools, processes and interactions should be designed with data availibility in mind
- People, who want to be competitive in AI age, should have data-literacy, sufficient to enable data-streams of whatever they do (that would enable AI to consume this data and function)
- Data-streaming of any process might be made easy with
  - physical devices

## Conclusions

- Cut transaction costs for information exchange by enabling data and information via AI (e.g. [org-wide chat with docs](org-wide-chat-with-docs.md))
  - Adopt Data availibility culture, that enables it

## Vision

I can imagine, that such thing as [org-wide chat with docs](org-wide-chat-with-docs.md) will be a very standard and typical thing to have for any organization, company, team in the world, regardless of what they do. It would be like having an e-mail. In order for that to happen, we need to have data storage available at very low cost (how much does a regular user pay for an e-mail? you can have a bunch for free, right?). Why not have a personal or company datalake for free, too? Maybe at some point, data storage devices will revolutionized to such extent, that storage drops in price, and it enables data-lakes for everyone, just like we have e-mails for everyone for free.
