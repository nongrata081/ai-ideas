[How to build a Raspberry Pi cluster](rptl.io/cluster)

![](./img/rpi-cluster.jpg)

Why would you build a physical cluster? Today you can go to Amazon, or Digital Ocean, or any of the other cloud providers, and spin up a virtual machine in seconds. But the cloud is just someone else’s computers: a Raspberry Pi cluster is a low-cost, versatile system you can use for all kinds of clustered-computing related technologies, and you have total control over the machines that constitute it. Building something from the ground up can teach you lessons you can’t learn elsewhere.
