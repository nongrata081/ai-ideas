# Compute platform

- As an owner of hardware capable of AI (say, I have an AI server) in order to maximize the RoI I'd have to have it running (e.g. training) for as much time as possible during each given timeframe (e.g. month). Ideally, have LMs trained on it 24/7. It would be nice to have a marketplace, that would combine the compute platform, to which I can connect my server, and possibility to rent it out to customers, interested in using it for training their LMs. Is there such a platform that allows to do it easily?
