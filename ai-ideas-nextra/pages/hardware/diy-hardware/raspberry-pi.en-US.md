A beautiful home server OS for self-hosting with an app store. Buy a pre-built Umbrel Home with umbrelOS, or install on a Raspberry Pi or any x86 system.

umbrel.com

At Umbrel, we believe that everyone should be able to enjoy the convenience and benefits of the cloud, without giving up ownership and control of their data.

To achieve our vision, we're building a new kind of personal server OS. Instead of paying ransoms for storing your data on someone else's computer while they auction it off to advertisers â€” you can now easily spin up a server and self-host your data and services at home.

Just like the cloud, but one that you own and control.
