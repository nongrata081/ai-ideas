# Use cases of AI agents

## Customer experience

AI agents can be integrated into websites and apps to enhance the customer experience by serving as a virtual assistants, providing mental health support, simulating interviews and other related tasks. There are many no-code templates for user implementation, making the process of creating these AI agents even easier.

## Healthcare

AI agents can be used for various real-world healthcare applications. Multi-agent systems can be particularly useful for problem-solving in such settings. From treatment planning for patients in the emergency department to managing drug processes, these systems save the time and effort of medical professionals for more urgent tasks.

## Emergency response

In case of natural disasters, AI agents can use [deep learning](https://www.ibm.com/topics/deep-learning) algorithms to retrieve the information of users on social media sites that need rescue. The locations of these users can be mapped to assist rescue services in saving more people in less time. Therefore, AI agents can greatly benefit human life in both mundane tasks and life-saving situations.
