# Code intelligence

## SourceGraph

- Add **code-intelligence** tool (for code search, fix, update) across codebases
    - with [sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com/) or something similar (& maintained as open-source)
    - [sourcegraph repo snapshot (not maintained)](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph-public-snapshot)
    - [batch-changes](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/batch-changes)

### Sourcegraph CLI

- [Sourcegraph CLI](https://github.com/sourcegraph/src-cli)



## Autoupdates for linkrot

Implement with https://github.com/internetarchive/internetarchivebot or something similar (when in a codebase files are moved, and links become broken because of that).
