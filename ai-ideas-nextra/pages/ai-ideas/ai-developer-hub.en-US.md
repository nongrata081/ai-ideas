# AI Developer Hub

[trends-&-expectations](ai-vision/trends-&-expectations)

Does it make sense to create **AI Developer Hub** - something like [Semantic Scholar](/research#semantic-scholar) but for **AI Developers community**? One single place on the web, that would aggregate (?) / give access to latest developments in the field of AI, LLMs, agents, etc., and be like a go-to place to get all the data for everything related, like alignment, interpretability, safety, accountability, performance, etc.
