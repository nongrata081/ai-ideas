# AI Data Registry

## AI Data Standard

- Develop a standard for data sources (websites? APIs? Whoever it be?) to expose the data for crawling for AI. (There is a need for real-time retrieval of actual data, on any matter. Would be nice if there is a standard way to obtain this data and a registry of resources that make it available).

## AI Data Registry

- Should I create such a registry? Is there such already in the market? 
- Consider creation of local registries (sets of links to certain sites, relevant to a given domain, that are to be crawled / made conclusions about, e.g. are there new tools for a task / domain, are there new research, etc.)
- Ideally all such sites / data sources should regularly (daily) run AI against their data to define such latest interesting stuff and expose it for consumption (including human readable way and APIs)

- For example, it might be a good idea to develop a page in [Enterprise-helper](/product/product-vision) for possible partnerships / counterparties, that might in any way be of interest. E.g. endowments, sponsorships, grants, bug-hunts, competitions, etc.
