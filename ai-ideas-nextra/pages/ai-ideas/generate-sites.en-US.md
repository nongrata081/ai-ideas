# Generate entire sites

Would be nice to generate entire (static) sites with a tool like Nextra, not just docs sites or blog sites as it is now, but all different possible kinds of sites, and with all different tech-stacks and UI-libs. i18n, SEO-friendly by default.

A CMS might not be needed as content would be edited from .md files in a repo.

Imagine Nextra site but with a UI built with MUI (?).

## Types of sites

- e-commerce
  - with products catalog page
  - with product details page
  - with checkout page
  - etc.
- portfolio
- etc.
