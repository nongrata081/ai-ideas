Send Postgres changes anywhere

Sequin sends Postgres records and changes to your applications and services. It’s designed to never miss an insert, update, or delete and provide exactly-once processing of all changes.

You can receive changes via HTTP push (webhooks) or pull (think SQS).

Use Sequin to add async triggers to your existing Postgres tables to reliably trigger side effects. Or, Sequin can add streaming mechanics to Postgres to do the work of SQS / Kafka without the operational overhead.
