This repository is intended for ideas about possible AI projects. Possibly, also their implementation. The motivation behind it is to maximize as much as possible the value for the community with AI tools, AI-literacy and collective reflection about ways and approaches to benefit with AI.

For now these ideas are just my random thoughts. I'd be happy to get any useful feedback, ideas, thoughts, critique and welcome to share your ideas as well.
