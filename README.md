This repository is intended for ideas about possible AI projects. Possibly, also their implementation. The motivation behind it is to maximize as much as possible the value for the community with AI tools, AI-literacy and collective reflection about ways and approaches to benefit with AI.

For now these ideas are just my random thoughts. I'd be happy to get any useful feedback, ideas, thoughts, critique and welcome to share your ideas as well.

### Setting up

#### Preferred method - VSCode Dev Container

[VSCode dev containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) are a great way to containerize not only the necessary requirements but also recommended IDE extensions as well as settings such as pre-commit hooks and linting preferences. Using this will allow you to jump in to the perfect Enterprise Helper contribution environment without having to do much. Additionally, you'll be able to contribute through the web browser using Github Codespaces!

To use our dev container:

1. Download [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
2. Download [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. Within VSCode, install the [Remote Development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) extension
4. Open the VSCode command palette (`cmd / ctrl + shift + p`)
5. Select `Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in container`. A new VSCode window should open up and it should begin setting up your environment. Once it's done, you can open up a new terminal and start running tests or contributing!
6. To test that your environment is set up correctly,
   open `nx console` extension tab and try running one of the executors (e.g. linting / testing / etc). You should be able to run all executors and see the output in the terminal.
7. After the initial build, you should now be able to leave and re-enter the container any time without needing to rebuild. To do this, open the command palette and select `Dev Containers: Reopen in container`. This will not rebuild the container if you've done it correctly.

8. To push the code, [share your Git Credentials with your container](https://code.visualstudio.com/remote/advancedcontainers/sharing-git-credentials) through one of the following:

   - with SHH (create an ssh key and add to your github profile)

     - run `gh auth login`

       - `? Where do you use GitHub? GitHub.com`
       - `? What is your preferred protocol for Git operations on this host? SSH`
       - `? Generate a new SSH key to add to your GitHub account? Yes`
       - `? Enter a passphrase for your new SSH key (Optional):` (tested without passphrase)
       - `? Title for your SSH key: GitHub CLI` (can be any)
       - `? How would you like to authenticate GitHub CLI? Login with a web browser`
       - `! First copy your one-time code:`
       - `Press Enter to open https://github.com/login/device in your browser...`
       - ```
         ✓ Authentication complete.
         - gh config set -h github.com git_protocol ssh
         ✓ Configured git protocol
         ! Authentication credentials saved in plain text

         ✓ Uploaded the SSH key to your GitHub account: /home/vscode/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
         ✓ Logged in as <GithubProfileName>
         ```

     - Add ssh key to the container's ssh

       ```
       ssh-add ~/.ssh/<your-ssh-key>

       # e.g.:
       # ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

       # Output: Identity added: /home/vscode/.ssh/id_ed25519 (/home/vscode/.ssh/id_ed25519)
       ```

   - is there easier way to do it with ssh? with ssh-agent auto-forwarding instead of creating a new ssh key?
   - with HTTPs

<!-- #### Alternative method - setup locally without containers

1.  Remove `package-lock.json` files (since those are platform specific and are generated by `npm install` for [linux docker image](mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/javascript-node:20-bookworm))
    and run `npm install` to get your platform-specific npm packages in `node_modules`

        ```shell
        # Create a new package-lock.json & install your platform-specific npm packages
        rm package-lock.json
        rm -rf node_modules
        npm install

        # Same for ai-ideas-nextra (knowledge base)
        cd ai-ideas/nextra
        rm package-lock.json
        rm -rf node_modules
        npm install
        ```

2.  Open `nx-console` extension tab in vscode and run executors from there or manually from the terminal, e.g.

    ```shell
    # linting
    npx nx run nextapp-ai-ideas:lint

    # dev with watch mode
    npx nx run nextapp-ai-ideas:dev

    # etc.
    ``` -->
